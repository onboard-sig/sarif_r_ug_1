For a normal distribution this can be done by putting the file into `${jetty.base}/lib`\n* Copy the file `${jetty.home}/modules/ssl.mod` to `${jetty.base}/modules`\n* Edit the `${jetty.base}/modules/ssl.mod` file to have the following section:\n```\n[lib]\nlib/sslfix6072.jar\n```\n\n* Copy the file `${jetty.home}/etc/jetty-https.xml` and `${jetty.home}/etc/jetty-http2.xml` to `${jetty.base}/etc`\n* Edit files `${jetty.base}/etc/jetty-https.xml` and `${jetty.base}/etc/jetty-http2.xml`, changing any reference of `org.eclipse.jetty.server.SslConnectionFactory` to `org.eclipse.jetty.server.ssl.fix6072.SpaceCheckingSslConnectionFactory`. \n\nFor example:\n```\n  \u003cCall name=\"addIfAbsentConnectionFactory\"\u003e\n    \u003cArg\u003e\n      \u003cNew class=\"org.eclipse.jetty.server.ssl.fix6072.SpaceCheckingSslConnectionFactory\"\u003e\n        \u003cArg name=\"next\"\u003ehttp/1.1\u003c/Arg\u003e\n        \u003cArg name=\"sslContextFactory\"\u003e\u003cRef refid=\"sslContextFactory\"/\u003e\u003c/Arg\u003e\n      \u003c/New\u003e\n    \u003c/Arg\u003e\n  \u003c/Call\u003e\n```\nRestart Jetty\n\n## References\n\n","text":"Eclipse Jetty is vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via invalid TLS frames.

Following types of the Java runtime are affected:\n\u003e\n\u003e * java.util.HashMap\n\u003e * java.util.HashSet\n\u003e * java.util.Hashtable\n\u003e * java.util.LinkedHashMap\n\u003e * java.util.LinkedHashSet\n\u003e Other third party collection implementations that use their element's hash code may also be affected\n\u003e A simple solution is to catch the StackOverflowError in the client code calling XStream.\n\u003e \n\u003e If your object graph does not use referenced elements at all, you may simply set the NO_REFERENCE mode:\n\u003e \n\u003e XStream xstream = new XStream();\n\u003e xstream.setMode(XStream.NO_REFERENCES);\n\u003e If your object graph contains neither a Hashtable, HashMap nor a HashSet (or one of the linked variants of it) then you can use the security framework to deny the usage of these types:\n\u003e \n\u003e XStream xstream = new XStream();\n\u003e xstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{\n\u003e  java.util.HashMap.class, java.util.HashSet.class, java.util.Hashtable.class, java.util.LinkedHashMap.class, java.util.LinkedHashSet.class\n\u003e });\n\u003e Unfortunately these types are very common. If you only use HashMap or HashSet and your XML refers these only as default map or set, you may additionally change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util.Set at unmarshalling time::\n\u003e \n\u003e xstream.addDefaultImplementation(java.util.TreeMap.class, java.util.Map.class);\n\u003e xstream.addDefaultImplementation(java.util.TreeSet.class, java.util.Set.class);\n\u003e However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n## References\n\n","text":"XStream is vulnerable to denial-of-service due to a stack overflow that exists due to a recursive hash set calculation.
